# 3D Parametric Surface Simulation with Torus Manifold Representation

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes a parametric surface in 3D space using Matplotlib. The mathematical framework behind this simulation is based on parametric surfaces and vector fields, with a focus on understanding the geometry of the surface generated by the parametric functions. This visualization provides insights into the geometric structure and surface behavior.

## Mathematical Explanation

### Parametric Equations

The parametric surface is defined by the following equations:

- $\gamma_1(m_1, m_2) = 4 \cos(m_1) \cos(m_2)$
- $\gamma_2(m_1, m_2) = 4 \cos(m_1) \sin(m_2)$
- $\gamma_3(m_1) = 4 \sin(m_1) + 5$

Where:
- $m_1, m_2 \in [0, 2\pi]$ are the parametric variables that sweep the surface.
- $4$ and $5$ are constants that control the scaling and positioning of the surface.

These parametric equations map the parameters $m_1$ and $m_2$ to a point $(x, y, z)$ on the surface in 3D space. 

### Surface Geometry

The surface is parameterized by $m_1$ and $m_2$, with $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ controlling the horizontal position, and $\gamma_3$ controlling the vertical position. The surface generated is periodic and has a sinusoidal behavior in the $z$ direction due to the sine and cosine terms in the equations.

### Derivative Approximation and Tangent Vectors

The **tangent vectors** at any point on the surface are derived from the partial derivatives of the parametric functions with respect to $m_1$ and $m_2$:

- $\frac{\partial}{\partial m_1} \mathbf{r}(m_1, m_2) = \left(\frac{\partial \gamma_1}{\partial m_1}, \frac{\partial \gamma_2}{\partial m_1}, \frac{\partial \gamma_3}{\partial m_1}\right)$
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial m_2} \mathbf{r}(m_1, m_2) = \left(\frac{\partial \gamma_1}{\partial m_2}, \frac{\partial \gamma_2}{\partial m_2}, 0\right)$

These vectors describe the local direction of the surface at each point.

### Gradient and Surface Curvature

The gradient is a key quantity in understanding the surface's curvature and local geometric properties. It can be approximated as the magnitude of the rate of change of the surface with respect to the parameters:

$$ \text{Gradient Magnitude} = \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\partial \gamma_1}{\partial m_1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial \gamma_2}{\partial m_1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial \gamma_3}{\partial m_1}\right)^2 } $$

This gradient provides insight into the rate of change of the surface.

### Visualization

The script plots the surface using Matplotlibâ€™s `plot_surface` function, allowing a 3D visualization of the parametric structure. Specific points of interest on the surface are marked as $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, $p_i$, and $p_j$, with their coordinates computed from the parametric equations.

### Parametric Curves

The following parametric curves are also plotted, representing sections of the surface:

- $m_2 = 0$ and $m_2 = \frac{\pi}{2}$
  
These curves show how the surface evolves along certain paths, providing additional insight into the geometry.

## Key Mathematical Frameworks

1. **Parametric Surface Representation**: 
   The surface is represented as a map:
   $$ \mathbf{r}(m_1, m_2) = (\gamma_1(m_1, m_2), \gamma_2(m_1, m_2), \gamma_3(m_1)) $$

2. **Differential Geometry**: 
   The **tangent vectors** at any point on the surface give insight into its local geometry, and the cross product of these vectors yields the **normal vector**, which is critical for understanding surface curvature.

3. **Visualization**: 
   The surface and its geometric properties are visualized using Matplotlib, with specific points and parametric curves highlighted to showcase important features.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, use the following command:

```bash
